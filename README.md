# IdentityHub
A light weight Single Sign On solution that helps the cross domains to allow single sign on.  This solution depends on token generation with different encryptions and the sites will use these tokens to bypass the login page of different applications.  All the tokens have very short life time (configurable) so that it is practically impossible to break the encryption.
